Name: Calculator
Version: 0.1 2/2/17
System Requirements: Galaxy Note 5 or Android Studio
Description:
	This is a basic calculator app for Android created in Android Studio. The calculator is designed in a similar way as a regular one is, except it is in a dark mode. The specifications are based off of a Galaxy Note 5. In the future, the entire layout will be dark and neon green and more symbols will be added in the future as well. Right now, the input will work with any numbers including decimal numbers and the basic functions such as: * / + -. I have added parentheses to the calculator as well; however, there is a bug and it doesn't always work correctly, so for now I have put them in red and are unable to be pressed. This calculator also catches whether a number is being divided by 0 as well as if an equation is invalid. There is an input box that takes in the input, the keyboard will remain hidden when text area is hit. The solution is displayed once the user hits the solve button. The solution is outputted underneath the text area. The user must hit the "C" or clear button to reset the input; otherwise, numbers or operators will be concatenated on to the previous input data. This a basic calculator so far, but I am hoping to keep improving it and turn it into a scientific one someday.

		The calculator was first created with basic functionality, +-/* and error catching.

		
Feel free to use my code and modify it in any way.
